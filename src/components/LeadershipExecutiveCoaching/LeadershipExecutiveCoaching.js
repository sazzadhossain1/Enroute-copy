                We have designed the executive and leadership coaching sessions
                to integrate spaces for action & spaces for reflection. The
                sessions are usually an hour long and arranged for individuals
                or as a group.

              <p className="whatWeDo-p p-for-pre leader-p">
                The number of sessions varies depending on the coachable items
                as agreed during contracting with the coachee. With Enroute’s
                professional leadership coaching, coachees are able to achieve
                enhanced performance, empowerment, a fresh perspective and
                acquire the necessary leadership qualities.
