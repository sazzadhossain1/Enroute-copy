                The terms Leadership and Executive Coaching are often used
                interchangeably. Both involve working with individuals in
                leadership positions, though Executive Coaching is often used to
                describe coaching with leaders in more senior roles. For our
                program, we have named it Leadership and Executive Coaching
                (LEC) as a catch-all.

                We have designed our executive leadership coaching program by
                combining the Systems, Psychodynamics, and Coaching approaches.

                within themselves and in their external environment by
                discovering their true selves and then ﬁnd the energy to change,
